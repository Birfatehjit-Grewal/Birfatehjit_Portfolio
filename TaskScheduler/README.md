<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The project was coded using an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) called PyCharm so all the imports are included in the project however you will still need to download Python. I also recommend using PyCharm to run this code. The application can be launched by running the app.py</p>

<h4>Latest version of Python</h4>

https://www.python.org/downloads/

<p>If you are planning on not using PyCharm to run this you may need to install PyQt6</p>
<p>This can be done by typing the command below into the command prompt (Terminal)</p>

<h4>Qt for Python (PyQt6)</h4>
<p>pip install PyQt6</p>

<p>In case the install does not work because pip was not recognized please make sure that it has correctly been added to the PATH</p>
